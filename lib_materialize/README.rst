Auctus materialization library
==============================

This library can materialize datasets from Auctus, the dataset search engine from NYU. You can use it to materialize search results directly on your side without relying on the server. It is also used internally by the service to materialize datasets (the ``/download`` endpoint downloads the dataset using this library then sends it to you).
