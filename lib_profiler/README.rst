Auctus data profiling library
=============================

This library can profile datasets. It is part of Auctus, the dataset search engine from NYU. You can use it to profile datasets, which results in the same metadata record as the one used in Auctus internally. You can also use that record to search Auctus, instead of uploading the whole dataset.
